                        <p>Hi there! My name is Nikita Sasunkevich. I absolutely love programming and can't seem to stop learning
                            everything about it. It is something that grabbed my attention in high school and never seemed
                            to leave my mind. Ever since college graduation, I have been constantly thinking about the route
                            I want to take professionally in the massive world of programming. Quickly after graduation,
                            I was able to stumble upon a web developer position. Choosing the the career path of web development
                            was probably the best choice I could've ever made as I have been loving it ever since. I would
                            say that my absolute favorite part of web development is all of the different technologies and
                            features we have at our disposal to create what we want and how we want it!</p>

                        <p>Alongside programming, I have many different passions as well. I am a total gearhead and love absolutely
                            everything about cars. The mechanics alone are mesmerizingly beautiful and give me nothing but
                            absolute joy. Hockey and football are my most favorite sports to play and watch. I have played
                            hockey for nearly 13 years and have been watching football for as long as I can remember. </p>

                        <p>Friends and family are the most important people in my life and I don't know where I would be without
                            them!
                        </p>
